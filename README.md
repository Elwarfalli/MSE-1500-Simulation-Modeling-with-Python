# MSE 1500 – Simulation Modeling with Python

This repository supports students enrolled in MSE 1500 to learn and explore simulation modeling concepts using Python.

📘 **About the Course**  
Simulation modeling is a powerful technique used to mimic the operation of real-world processes or systems over time. This repository includes practical notebooks and scripts to help students learn through hands-on coding and visualization.
